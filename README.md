# Nessus Red Hat CVE Checker

**Nessus Red Hat CVE Checker** is a Java tool that:

- Automatically extracts CVE identifiers from `.nessus` scan files generated by Tenable Nessus.
- Queries the Red Hat public API for detailed information about each CVE, including severity, CVSS score, advisories, fix state, and affected products.
- Filters results by a specific Red Hat product (e.g., *Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7*).
- Exports all relevant details to a `.csv` file for further analysis or reporting.

---

## Features

- Parses `.nessus` XML files to find CVEs
- Queries Red Hat's API: `https://access.redhat.com/hydra/rest/securitydata/cve/CVE-XXXX-XXXX.json`
- Filters by specific Red Hat product (e.g., RHEL 7 or 8)
- Progress bar in the terminal during processing
- CSV output with all relevant data (advisory, severity, fix state, etc.)
